[{"authors":["erawijantari"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a Postdoctoral Researcher under Turku Collegium for Science, Medicine, and Technology at University of Turku where I worked mainly with group of Turku Data Science Group with close collaboration with Turku Hypertension Center. In this group, I take part in exploring the gut microbiome world through various data analysis approaches toward clinical application.\nOriginally my initial training was in biology, where I have worked on the deep-sea metagenomics study, synthetic biology, and phytochemical effectiveness as anticancer treatment. Currently, I am mostly working behind the computer. My current and proposed postdoctoral project focuses on bioinformatic analysis of human gut microbiome variation and health associations in a large population cohort of Finnish individuals. This study uses the multi-omics approaches, which involve the metagenomics and metabolomics analyses on human fecal samples. I used Python, R, and shell scripting for my projects, which mostly run in the cluster computer. Complexity and fast-growing data in microbiome study also push me to learn a lot of new skills, which are a fascinating process. I am particularly interested in understanding the roles of microbiome as an effect or consequence in human health conditions. I am passionate about the multidisciplinary and interactive research project, particularly pursuing my interest and developing a new research idea related to the gut microbiome variation and its implication to human health condition.\nAside as a researcher, I am also a mom who love to spend time with my daughter. I like to read a book with her, mostly about parenting, popular science, and children story books. I love singing, Balinese dancing, and trying new food recipes.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e535682055c2df5fabf3b0c21cfc54c6","permalink":"https://erawijantari.github.io/authors/erawijantari/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/erawijantari/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Postdoctoral Researcher under Turku Collegium for Science, Medicine, and Technology at University of Turku where I worked mainly with group of Turku Data Science Group with close collaboration with Turku Hypertension Center.
