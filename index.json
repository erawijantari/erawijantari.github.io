In this group, I learn and take part in exploring gut microbiome through various data analysis approaches.\nOriginally my initial training was in biology where I have worked on the deep-sea metagenomics study, synthetic biology, and phytochemical effectiveness as anticancer treatment. Currently, I am mostly working behind the computer. My current research mainly focus on the dynamics of human gut microbiome in the gastrointestinal-related diseases. In particular, I have worked on the gastrectomy effect on human gut microbiome in a gastric cancer case and will expand my study on the effect of the other gastrointestinal barrier alteration. This study uses the multi-omics approaches which involves the metagenomics and metabolomics analyses on human fecal samples. I used Python, R, and shell scripting for my projects which mostly run in the cluster computer. Complexity and fast growing data in microbiome study also push me to learn a lot of new skills which are very exciting process. I am particularly interested in understanding the roles of microbiome as an effect or consequences in gastrointestinal related diseases and treatment effectiveness.\nAside from research, I also one of initiator and contributor to biweekly data analysis discussion for local Indonesian community in Tokyo Institute of Technology. You can check our activity in our notes. I also like to spend my spare time on reading, mostly popular science books and novels. I love singing, Balinese dancing, and curently playing ocarina.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"e535682055c2df5fabf3b0c21cfc54c6","permalink":"https://erawijantari.github.io/authors/erawijantari/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/erawijantari/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a PhD candidate in School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology where I am belong to Yamada Laboratory group.
