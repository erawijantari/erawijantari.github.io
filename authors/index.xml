      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a PhD candidate in School of Life Science and Technology, Tokyo Institute of Technology where I belong to &lt;a href=&#34;http://comp.bio.titech.ac.jp/home-en/&#34;&gt;Yamada Laboratory group&lt;/a&gt;. In this group, I learn and take part in exploring the gut microbiome world through various data analysis approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally my initial training was in biology, where I have worked on the deep-sea metagenomics study, synthetic biology, and phytochemical effectiveness as anticancer treatment. Currently, I am mostly working behind the computer. My current research mainly focus on the dynamics of human gut microbiome in  gastrointestinal-related diseases. In particular, I have worked on the gastrectomy effect on human gut microbiome in a gastric cancer case. This study uses the multi-omics approaches, which involve the metagenomics and metabolomics analyses on human fecal samples. I used Python, R, and shell scripting for my projects, which mostly run in the cluster computer. Complexity and fast-growing data in microbiome study also push me to learn a lot of new skills, which are a fascinating process. I am particularly interested in understanding the roles of microbiome as an effect or consequence in gastrointestinal-related diseases and treatment effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from research, I also one of initiators and contributors to biweekly data analysis discussions for local Indonesian community at Tokyo Institute of Technology. You can check our activity in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/erawijantari/RPyId&#34;&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. I also like to spend my spare time reading, mostly popular science books and novels. I love singing, Balinese dancing, and currently playing ocarina.&lt;/p&gt;
